  "interiorParagraph": "An interior is not just a space — it is a physical projection of your personality. I create designs that don’t follow trends, but express essence: organic, technological, emotionally immersive. Everything — from lines to light — is crafted to evoke a sense of comfort and refinement. This is not decoration, but a living environment where every form has purpose, every surface breathes aesthetics, and the style is you. You deserve a space created not from templates, but from your unique code.",
